## Notes
This application is displaying information supplied purely on the frontend. I built this 
app in such a way that it expects a system to be set up to eventually make server calls.

## Potential Enhancements
* Ability to save and view Favorites.
* Ability to submit new Restaurants.
* Implement a backend to serve data, rather than using dummy data.
* Store and retrieve restaurant information from a Database.
* Add register/login functionality.
